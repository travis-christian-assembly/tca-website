#### 3.1 Check package health

  * Run command: `npm prune`
* Check if there are upgradable dependencies
  * Run command: `npm outdated`
  * To update a certain dependency
    * Run command: `npm install <DEPENDENCY_NAME>@latest --save`
    * e.g. `npm install gatsby@latest --save`
  * To update all dependencies to the `wanted` versions
    * Run command: `npm update --save/--save-dev`
  * Reproduce the version lock of this package's dependency closure after any dependency upgrade
    * Run command: `npm shrinkwrap --dev`
